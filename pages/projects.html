                <h3><a href='https://github.com/Alex-Scov/webscraping'> FTSE Web Scrapers</a></h3>
                <p>I created a pair of web scrapers that go to the relevant pages on the London Stock Exchange Website and prints the days trading statistics to the terminal. This could easily be amended to take actions if certain trading parameters were met. I am currently working on inputting the data into a MySQL database for future data analysis.<br>
                Technologies used include: Python, BeautifulSoup, requests, NumPy, pandas.</p>
